            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <p>We know there are many types of families, and that is why there are many types of approaches to learning a new language! Just pick a family language plan that works for your family, and be consistent and very, very patient!</p>

            <h2>MLAH - Minority Language At Home</h2>
            <img class="resources-photo" src="images/familyathome.jpg" alt="family at home">
            <p>The Minority Language at Home approach is when parents speak a different language at home than the majority language that is spoken in their community, often in an attempt to maintain a sense of cultural heritage and increase minority language exposure.</p>

            <h2>TAP - Time and Place</h2>
            <img class="resources-photo" src="images/familyatthepark.jpg" alt="family at the park">
            <p>The T&P approach means that parents separate the languages used with the child either by time or by place (or both). Some families have found that frequent swapping between languages is difficult to keep up with and have opted for longer periods for each language.</p>

            <h2>MLS - Mixed Language Strategy</h2>
            <img class="resources-photo" src="images/familia.jpg" alt="family">
            <p>A mixed-language policy involves using two languages interchangeably. Rather than having one language under one set of circumstances, such as “when talking to Mom” or “at school,” and another language in other circumstances, a mixed language policy uses both languages in all circumstances.</p>

            <h2>OPOL - One Person, One Language</h2>
            <img class="resources-photo" src="images/dadandbaby.jpg" alt="dad and baby">
            <p>The One Person, One Language (OPOL) is a common bilingual parenting approach in which one caretaker speaks to a child in one language, and a second person speaks to a child in another language. For more information on this method, <a href="opol.html">click here.</a></p>
