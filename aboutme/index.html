    <h2>Samanta Del Moral</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Samanta, and I'm originally from Mexico. I've been living in the US for about 13 years. Since moving to the US, I have lived in 5 states (Az, Tx, Ut, Fl, Va). We live in Virginia now, and I love it here; it has been my favorite place. </p>
        <p>I met and married my husband eight years ago, and we have three little boys (6,4 and 1-year-old).</p>
       <p> I'm pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. I feel very blessed to have the chance to study online because it gives me the freedom to choose my study hours.  </p>
      <p>  I don't have many hobbies right now because of kids. Instead, I spend my day doing stuff with them and trying to keep the house clean. But I enjoy crafting and gardening, and I absolutely love to travel; last summer, we went on a two-month-long road trip and visited 20 National Parks! all while doing school at the same time!</p> 
       <p> I've been a member of the church since 2010, and it has been the best decision of my life! </p>
       <p> this is a test</p>
